<h3>
Raspberry Pi Dshot protocol implementation.
</h3>

<b><a href="https://github.com/Marian-Vittek/raspberry-pi-dshot">This project</a></b> implements DSHOT protocol to control ESCs via the GPIO
pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It has been developed and used in a Raspberry
Pi Zero 2.

It uses busy wait and 'clock_gettime' for timing. It handles DSHOT 150
protocol well. Other versions may cause problems.

The code is inspired by
https://github.com/dmrlawson/raspberrypi-dshot. Compared to the
original, this version differs in two points:

- It uses "clock_gettime" instead of an empty loop.  It allows
- multiple frames to be sent to multiple pins at once.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors, type

    	   make test sudo chrt -f 99 ./test

If it does not run, you may need to edit 'motor-dshot.c' and adjust
DSHOT_AD_HOC_OFFSET macro.
