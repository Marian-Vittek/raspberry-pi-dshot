This is a very quick and dirty C code to send DSHOT frames to ESCs via
the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It was developed and used in a
Raspberry Pi zero 2 computer, but it should work for other Pis if you
choose the right version of the dshot protocol.


It uses busy wait loops for timing. Fortunately, dshot protocol frames
take only a few microseconds. In such a short time there is little
chance that the process will be interrupted by the OS. As a result,
the code is usable if you choose the right version of dshot protocol.
We use it for dshot 300 with frames taking 53.28us.


The code is inspired by
https://github.com/dmrlawson/raspberrypi-dshot. Compared to the
original, this version it is improved in two ways:


- It allows multiple frames to be sent to multiple pins at once.
- There is automatic calibration of constants for busy wait loops.




To compile and run a simple test spinning 4 motors, type

    	   make test
	   sudo ./test
