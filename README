This is an ad-hoc implementation of the DSHOT protocol to control ESCs
via the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It has been developed and used
in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2.

It uses busy wait and 'clock_gettime' for timing. It handles DSHOT 150
protocol well. Other versions may cause problems.

The code is inspired by
https://github.com/dmrlawson/raspberrypi-dshot. Compared to the
original, this version differs in two points:

- It uses "clock_gettime" instead of an empty loop.
- It allows multiple frames to be sent to multiple pins at once.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors, type

    	   make test
	   sudo chrt -f 99 ./test

If it does not run, you may need to edit 'motor-dshot.c' and adjust
DSHOT_AD_HOC_OFFSET macro.
